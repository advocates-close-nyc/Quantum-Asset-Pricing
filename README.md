# Quantum Asset Pricing

## Overview
This repository explores quantum computing's transformative potential in financial asset pricing. By leveraging quantum algorithms, we demonstrate how to:
- Detect arbitrage opportunities.
- Optimize portfolios with enhanced accuracy.
- Price derivatives faster than classical methods.

## Why Quantum?
Classical algorithms often struggle with:
- Complex dependencies in high-dimensional financial models.
- Computational bottlenecks in Monte Carlo simulations.

Quantum computing offers exponential or quadratic speedups, enabling real-time insights previously unattainable.

## Use Cases
- **Arbitrage Detection:** Identify mispriced assets faster than traditional models.
- **Portfolio Optimization:** Efficiently allocate resources across thousands of assets.
- **Option Pricing:** Speed up pricing for exotic derivatives.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/advocates-close-nyc/Quantum-Asset-Pricing.git
